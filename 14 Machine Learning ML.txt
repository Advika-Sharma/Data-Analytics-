Introduction to Machine Learning


Machine Learning is a Subset of Al that is based on the idea that machines can be given access to data along with the ability to learn from it."

The capability of Artificial Intelligence systems to learn by extracting patterns from data is known as Machine Learning.

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (Al) that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Artificial Intelligence in Practice

Al is redefining industries by providing greater personalization to users and automating processes.

Applications of Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are being increasingly used in various functions such as:

Image Recognition: Machine learning is used to identify objects, people,

places, and scenes in images. This is used in a variety of applications, such as facial recognition in social media photos, security systems that can identify unauthorized individuals, and self-driving cars that can navigate the road.

Speech Recognition: Machine learning is used to convert spoken language into text. This is used in a variety of applications, such as voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, dictation software, and automated call centers.


Recommender Systems: Machine learning is used to recommend products,

movies, music, and other items to users. This is based on the user's past behavior and preferences, as well as the behavior of other users with similar tastes.

Fraud Detection: Machine learning is used to detect fraudulent activity, such as credit card fraud and identity theft. This is done by analyzing patterns in data to identify suspicious behavior.



Self-Driving Cars: Machine learning is a key component of self-driving cars. It is used to teach cars how to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely.

Medical Diagnosis: Machine learning is used to analyze medical data to help

doctors diagnose diseases. This can be done by analyzing images, such as X- rays and MRIs, or by analyzing other data, such as a patient's medical history and blood test results.

Applications of machine learning : Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are being increasingly used in various functions such as : Image processing , healthcare, robotics , text analysis , data mining , video games, image processing: image tagging and recognition, self driving cars, optical character recognition, robotics, human simulation, industrial robotics, text analysis, sentiment analysis, spam filtering, information extraction.


supervised learning is used to train models using labeled training data. it provides the ability to predict the output of future or unseen data 
: the goal of supervised learning algorithm is to discover a mapping function that will translate the input variable (x) to the output variable (y).
