History: created by Guido Van Rossum (father of python)
late 1980s //Dutch programmer 

first version of python: 1991(0.9.0)-February 1991
//exception handling, functions and modules 

python 1.0(1994)- January 1994
//lambda functions, map, filters

python 2.x(2000s)-
//continuous growth 

python 3.0(2008)-known as python 3000 or Py3k
//major milestone in python evaluation 
//improving consistency, better adoption

python :
features and characteristics-

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming. 

Designed by: Guido van Rossum

Developer: Python Software Foundation 

Filename extensions: .py,.pyw,.pyz,.pyi,.pyc,.pyd

First appeared: 20 February 1991; 33 years ago

Paradigm: Multi-paradigm: object-oriented, procedural (imperative), functional, structured, reflective

Stable release: 3.12.4 / 6 June 2024; 32 days ago
Typing discipline: duck, dynamic, strong; optional type annotations (since 3.5, but those hints are ignored, except with unofficial tools)

//Applications for Python

Python is used in many application domains. Here's a sampling.

The Python Package Index lists thousands of third party modules for Python.


//Web and Internet Development

Python offers many choices for web development:

Frameworks such as Django and Pyramid.
Micro-frameworks such as Flask and Bottle.
Advanced content management systems such as Plone and django CMS.
Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:

HTML and XML
JSON
E-mail processing.
Support for FTP, IMAP, and other Internet protocols.
Easy-to-use socket interface.
And the Package Index has yet more libraries:

Requests, a powerful HTTP client library.
Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML.
Feedparser for parsing RSS/Atom feeds.
Paramiko, implementing the SSH2 protocol.
Twisted Python, a framework for asynchronous network programming.


//Scientific and Numeric


Python is widely used in scientific and numeric computing:

SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.
Pandas is a data analysis and modeling library.
IPython is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of a work session, and supports visualizations and parallel computing.
The Software Carpentry Course teaches basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials.



//Education


Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.

Books such as How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, and Practical Programming.
The Education Special Interest Group is a good place to discuss teaching issues.


//Desktop GUIs



The Tk GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python.

Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available separately:

wxWidgets
Kivy, for writing multitouch applications.
Qt via pyqt or pyside
Platform-specific toolkits are also available:

GTK+
Microsoft Foundation Classes through the win32 extensions



//Software Development



Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.

SCons for build control.
Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing.
Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project management.


//Business Applications


Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:

Odoo is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications.
Tryton is a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.

python --

1.easy to learn and read 

hello world 


-in java
class hello{
public static void main(){
system.out.print("hello world")


-in python
print("hello world")

2.interpreted and interactive 
 ->python is interpreted language
(the code is executed line by line)

3.versitile and flexible 
 ->python is multipurpose language suitable for wide range of applications
such as:
web development 
data science 
machine learning 
automation
scientific computing etc..

4.rich standard library: it provides modules and packages for performing a wide range of tasks (from working with files and databases)

5.large ecosystem 
 ->popular libraries: NumPy, Pandas , Tenser flow , flask , Django etc..

6.cross platform:
 -> the code written in python can run on various operating systems (OS) including windows, masOS and Linux, without modification 
 ->that need to be run on different environments 

7.open source
